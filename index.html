      <h3 class="text-align-left">Electronic hobbyist</h3>
      <p class="text-align-left">First circuit that I made was a water level meter using salt-waler, pencil graphite, batteries and an LED salvaged from a torchlight.
        The love for electronics continued then onwards. Every electronic hobbyist has to come across 555 timer, flipflop or LM714. I spent a lot of time making
        electronic gadgets like intruder detection with PIC sensor, simple ones like automatic street lamp using LDR sensors. I was also amazed to see the power of
        development boards like Arduino or Raspberry pi. Later I also did IoT projects with IBM Watson. What I find intriguing is that complex but real problems can be
        solved with these gadgets and the possibility is infinite. One of my projects can be found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/MEASUREMENT-OF-RPM-OF-DC-MOTOR-USING-ARDUINO-AND-I/" target="_blank">here.</a>

      <h3 class="text-align-left">Love to build software</h3>
      <p class="text-align-left">I never thought of building software unless I met with <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. I am not a guy who will write
        some undecipherable software shown in movies and use it through the command line, but yes, sometimes extra GUI becomes overkill. I was introduced
        with <a href="https://kivy.org/#home" target="_blank">Kivy</a>, a cross-platform Python framework and I loved it. I can remember one of my First
        wow moments when I successfully built a group chat application using <a href="https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">socketio</a> and Kivy and
        a slight touch of <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> for the database. I also developed one functional software to compare different map providers which can be found <a href="https://github.com/epsi95/map-comparison"
          target="_blank">here.</a>
        Apart from python I worked with <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android studio</a> and developed one Car-Key-Manager app, which can be used to book a car with inbuilt chat functionality. It was java until I came
        across <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a>. I am just loving this framework.
        Some projects I am working with this framework. Apart from that, I worked with HTML, CSS & Javascript to build a functional <a href="https://github.com/epsi95/app-manager-website" target="_blank">app build management</a> website. Apart from
        software development I also worked
        with machine learning models to develop use cases for my organization.</p>

      <h3 class="text-align-left">Cooking</h3>
      <p class="text-align-left">Being a Bengalee is not complete if you don't know cooking. Well, I do not proclaim myself
        as one of the top chefs but I can cook some tasty cuisines. I can remember my childhood days in a native village in West Bengal,
        where we, friends used to play "ranna-bati" where we used to gather vegetables, rice from home and cook them in a clay pot.
        Wise people will say cooking is an art, well everything is an art, but the point is I really love cooking.</p>

      <h3 class="text-align-left">Writing and sketching</h3>
      <p class="text-align-left">Also for a Bengalee, poetry is a must. I like to indulge myself in writing
        when I feel writing so. You can check out my small facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chirkut11/" target="_blank">page</a>. You can
        also get a glimpse of some of my paintings <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/10159133-Sketch?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=epsi95&utm_content=Sketch&utm_medium=Social_Share" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
